🚔 Crime Rate Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This project aims to predict crime rates using machine learning models based on historical crime data. The goal is to analyze crime trends and identify high-risk areas.

📂 Dataset
The dataset is stored in crime.csv.
Includes crime incidents, locations, timestamps, and other influencing factors.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data Handling
Scikit-learn – Machine Learning Models
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data Visualization

🏗️ Model Workflow
Dataset Preprocessing – Handling missing values, cleaning data
Train-Test Split – Dividing data for training and evaluation
Model Selection & Evaluation – Testing different ML models
Ranking Models – Based on Mean Squared Error (MSE)

📉 Results
The model ranks different machine learning algorithms based on MSE to find the best-performing one.

🔥 Future Enhancements
Implement Deep Learning models for better accuracy
Develop a real-time crime prediction system
Integrate with geospatial analysis for better visualization
